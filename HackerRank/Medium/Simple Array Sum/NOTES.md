          Simple Array Sum

          - Summary: The code uses a List (dynamic array) to store integers.  It reads an integer representing the array size, then reads a line of space-separated integers, converting them into a List<Integer>.  The `simpleArraySum` function iterates through this list, summing the elements, and returns the total. Finally, the result is written to the standard output.

          - Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is because the `simpleArraySum` function iterates through the array once to calculate the sum.
          - Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.  This is due to the storage of the input array in the `ar` List. The space used by other variables is constant.

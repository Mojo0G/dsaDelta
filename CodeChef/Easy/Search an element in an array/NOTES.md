          Search an element in an array

          - Summary: The code uses a Scanner to read input from the console. It reads an integer 'n' representing the array size, then an integer 'x' to search for. It iterates 'n' times, reading each array element and checking if it equals 'x'. A boolean variable 'isfound' tracks if 'x' is found. Finally, it prints "YES" if 'x' is found, otherwise "NO". No explicit data structures like arrays or HashMaps are used; the input is processed sequentially.

          - Time Complexity: O(n) because the code iterates through the input array once, where 'n' is the number of elements in the array.
          - Space Complexity: O(1) because the code uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size. The variables 'n', 'x', 'isfound', and 'ce' occupy a fixed amount of memory.

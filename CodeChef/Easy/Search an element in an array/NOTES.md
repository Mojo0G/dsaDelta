          Search an element in an array

          - Summary: The code uses a Scanner to read input from the console. It reads an integer n representing the size of an array, and an integer x representing the target element to search for. It then iterates through n integers, read one by one from the input. During iteration, it checks if any of the input integers is equal to x. If a match is found, a boolean variable is set to true, otherwise it remains false. Finally, based on the boolean variable, it prints "YES" if x was found, or "NO" otherwise.

          - Time Complexity: O(n), because the code iterates through the input array of size n once in the worst case.
          - Space Complexity: O(1), because the code only uses a few integer variables and a boolean variable; the space used does not depend on the input size n.

          Search an element in an array

          - Summary: The Java code uses a Scanner to read input from the console.  It takes an integer 'n' representing the array size and an integer 'x' to search for. It then iterates through 'n' integers read from input, checking if each integer is equal to 'x'. A boolean variable tracks whether 'x' is found. Finally, it prints "YES" if 'x' is found and "NO" otherwise. No explicit data structures beyond the input integers and a boolean variable are used.

          - Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is because the code iterates through the array once in the worst case.
          - Space Complexity: O(1). The space used by the program is constant, regardless of the input size.  The variables n, x, isfound, and ce occupy a fixed amount of memory.

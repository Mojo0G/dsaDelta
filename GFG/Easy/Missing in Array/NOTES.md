          Missing in Array

          - Summary: The code utilizes an array to store input numbers. It leverages the XOR bitwise operation to find the missing number. First, it XORs all numbers from 1 to n (n being the array length +1, representing the expected upper bound of the sequence), effectively calculating the XOR sum of the complete sequence. Then, it XORs this sum with the XOR sum of all numbers present in the input array. The final XOR result reveals the missing number because XORing a number with itself results in 0, canceling out the present numbers and leaving only the missing number.

          - Time Complexity: O(n), because the code iterates through the input array once and through the range 1 to n once, where n is the length of the array plus 1. Both iterations are linear in terms of input size.
          - Space Complexity: O(1), as the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space to store variables such as 'n' and 'xor'.  The space used does not scale with the input array size.
